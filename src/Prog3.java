||  Class Prog3
||
||         Author:  Alexander Yee
||
||        Purpose:  This class offers the user a menu of questions that 
||					are answered by using JDBC to interact with the database,
||					created by the SQL files that are created using Scrub.java,
||					to fetch the query results and display in a special format.
||					
||					
The snippet below is from Dr.McCann's sample JDBC program.
* At the time of this writing, the version of Oracle is 11.2g, and
* the Oracle JDBC driver can be found at
*   /opt/oracle/product/10.2.0/client/jdbc/lib/ojdbc14.jar
* on the lectura system in the UofA CS dept.
* (Yes, 10.2, not 11.2.  It's the correct jar file but in a strange location.)
*
* To compile and execute this program on lectura:
*
*   Add the Oracle JDBC driver to your CLASSPATH environment variable:
*
*         export CLASSPATH=/opt/oracle/product/10.2.0/client/jdbc/lib/ojdbc14.jar:${CLASSPATH}
*
*     (or whatever shell variable set-up you need to perform to add the
*     JAR file to your Java CLASSPATH)
*
*   Compile this file:
*
*         javac Prog3.java
*
*   Finally, run the program:
*
*         java Prog3 <oracle username> <oracle password>
